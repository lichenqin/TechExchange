----Q:  Today while I am trying to accomplish the "Hello world Demo" of Node.js, there is one mistake. 
        I run the server, and then I thought there are mistakes in the code so I use "control + Z" to stop it in the console.
        After I finished my debugging, I run it again. And here is what the node said: "Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8888"
        which means that at the very first time, when I run the program, the listen function bound the 8888 port, and "ctr Z" can not free the 8888 port.

----A:  So, here are two solutions. One is that using "ctr C" instead of "ctr Z" to shut the server down (I don't know whether I express it in the right way).
        The other is when you use "ctr Z", you should use comman "netstat -nap | grep node", which will show you all the port and the progress id of them.
        Find the id like "13186/node..." which is in the same line of 8888. Type in "kill -9 13186", and everything will be fine as usual.
